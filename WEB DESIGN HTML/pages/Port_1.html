                Computer engineers design hardware focusing on its purpose, rather than the details of transistor layout. They create processors for systems of all sizes, whether they resemble computers or not. 

                <br><br><br>Computer Engineers connect hardware and software to make technology work seamlessly.
                They power innovations like self-driving cars, robotics, and smart devices.
                Everyday gadgets from phones to Wi-Fi depend on Computer Engineering.
                They design reliable systems for space, defense, and extreme environments.

                <p class="text-text-grey text-lg max-w-3xl text-justify">
                Computer science is the study of computers, their theoretical foundations, hardware and software, and information processing. It includes algorithms, data structures, network design, modeling, and artificial intelligence. Drawing from mathematics and engineering, it incorporates techniques like queueing theory, probability, statistics, and electronic circuit design. 

                <br><br>
                <br>Ada Lovelace is considered the world’s first programmer for writing an algorithm in the 1840s for Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine.
                The first computer bug was literally a moth found stuck in a Harvard Mark II computer in 1947.
                The term “computer” originally referred to people (mostly women) who performed complex calculations by hand before machines took over.
                The ENIAC (1945) was the first general-purpose electronic computer, and it was programmed by six women pioneers.
                Email existed before the World Wide Web, with the first email sent by Ray Tomlinson in 1971.

                <br> - The first 1GB hard drive in 1980 weighed over 500 pounds.
                <br> - There are more devices connected to the internet than people on Earth.
                <br> - -The first website ever created is still online (info.cern.ch).
                <br> - Over 90% of the world’s data was created in just the last two years.

                <p class="text-text-grey text-lg max-w-3xl text-justify">
                Software engineering is a computer science field that involves designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software applications, including games, business applications, operating systems, and middleware, using programming languages. 

                <br><br>
                <br>The term “Software Engineering” was first used in 1968 at a NATO conference.
                The first software engineers were mostly mathematicians and scientists.
                NASA used early software engineering methods to land Apollo 11 on the moon.
                Open-source software (like Linux) changed the way software is built and shared.
                Agile and DevOps transformed software development into faster, flexible cycles.
