            <p class="text-text-grey text-lg max-w-3xl">
            <BR>The primary circuit board of a computer system is called the motherboard. It links all of
            the internal parts, including the processor, graphics card, memory, and other hardware.
            Additionally, it gives each component power and enables communication between them. It is
            impossible to overestimate the significance of the motherboard as a crucial component of any
            computer. In essence, bringing all of the various parts of a computer together is the
            motherboard's job. From USB ports to RAM, it contains connectors for almost every kind of
            component. Your computer can perform the tasks you want it to by connecting these parts
            together, which enables communication between them.<br>
            The majority of motherboards nowadays have a few standard parts. The Central
            Processing Unit (CPU), Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), Random Access Memory (RAM),
            Read Only Memory (ROM), and Southbridge chipsets are among them. Furthermore, some
            motherboards come equipped with extra functions like onboard audio processors and Ethernet or
            FireWire connectors.

            <p class="text-text-grey text-lg max-w-3xl">
            <BR>A motherboard doesn't seem like a "performance" component like a CPU or graphics
            card at first glance. According to what I understand, the function is to connect the different
            hardware components and provide a few USB and other interface ports on the rear. Therefore,
            any motherboard that supported the socket of my CPU seemed to be just as good as any other
            when it came to motherboard purchases. What distinguishes them from one another exactly?
            When deciding if a motherboard will meet my needs, what should I check for?

                necessitates the installation of these components via PCIe slots.

                The CPU socket, a connector that physically and electrically joins the central processing
                unit (CPU) to the motherboard, is known as the "CPU slot" on a motherboard. It has a certain pin
                or contact pattern that needs to match the CPU being installed and enables communication
                between the CPU and other parts like memory and storage.

                Are actual motherboard connectors where RAM (Random-Access Memory) modules,
                also known as memory sticks or DIMMs, are inserted. They serve as a link between the
                computer's processor and RAM, enabling the system to store and retrieve data rapidly and
                efficiently for program execution. These slots' quantity and color might reveal the kind of RAM
                that is supported as well as how to set up modules for optimal performance, like dual-channel
                configuration.

                <p class="text-text-grey text-lg max-w-3xl text-justify">
                PCI slots are motherboard expansion slots that let you install additional hardware cards,
                such as network, sound, or even older graphics cards, to increase a computer's capability. By
                acting as a standardized interface, they enable the installation of different expansion cards to
                enhance or add new features to the system. The primary function of old PCI is still to link
                peripheral components, even though it is largely obsolete and has been replaced by the quicker
                PCI Express (PCIe) standard.

                Is a computer bus interface that connects mass storage devices, such as solid-state drives
                (SSDs) and hard drives (HDDs), to a computer's motherboard. It stands for Serial Advanced
                Technology Attachment. With advantages including higher data transfer speeds and thinner,
                more flexible connections, it has largely superseded the outdated Parallel ATA (PATA) standard
                and is the most widely used interface for consumer-grade storage devices.
